# Popup Events Discoverability Platform

## The problem

Discoverability is a huge issue for both popup event organizers and their participants. Many interesting initiatives might lack the broader network to reach the right audiences and gauge interest, find funding and ultimately receive applications and ticket sales. Participants might not hear about fitting events until it's too late.

A platform that allows organizers to post their events and updates could solve this and allow interested parties to search and follow the progress of events much easier. A platform like this should include all "traditional" features that we know from web2, like search, notifications, recommendation algorithms, integration with other platforms and more while being built on "cypherpunk" principles. Decentralized, privacy preserving, uncensorable.

Think scrolling through lu.ma and signing up for all events that sound good, but with popups ;)

## Challenges

- Moderation: it is hard to know if an event is "legit", a serious attempt and not spam/scam. This could be solved with mechanisms like social consensus, conviction voting, staking (kickbacks) or pre-sales of tickets
- Reach of the platform itself: Discoverability platforms only work if they themself have enough reach. By being a "central hub" for popup events and their updates, the platform could become a "household name" and the go-to place to look for new events. Built on open and accessible data structures and APIs it would enable to integrate with other platforms, for example embedding farcaster feeds

## Roadmap

- Build a platform using decentralized and privacy preserving technologies for organizers to post their events
- Implement a private voting mechanism for people to show interest in events
- Implement feeds for organizers to post news and organizational updates
- Implement notifications, recommendation algorithms and other important features
- Integrate with widely used event platforms like lemonade and social layer to fetch relevant data and let users enter into the flow of applying and buying tickets
